# FociQ(antifier)
FociQ is a python written application to quantify nuclear foci in cells. It uses ImageJ to process given images containing foci. The images may contain multiple cells/nuclei which must be marked in the **blue** channel, foci are quantified using the **green** channel of the image. The **images must be multichannel**, images containing only a single channel must be merged before use.
